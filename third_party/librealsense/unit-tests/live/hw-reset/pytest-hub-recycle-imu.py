# Hub-recycle stress test: power-cycles the USB port the device under test is
# connected to (true cold plug-in via the OS, not an in-band hardware_reset),
# then verifies that the re-enumerated device exposes its full sensor set,
# in particular the Motion Module on IMU-bearing devices.
#
# This catches the partial-enumeration race where, on Windows, the device-
# watcher's debounce fires a "device added" callback before the HID Sensor
# Collection has bound at T0+~1s, surfacing a UVC-only device with no IMU and
# triggering "No HID info provided, IMU is disabled" / "HID Motion Sensor
# Failure! bad optional access" in the log.
#
# Uses the existing rspy.devices.enable_only(recycle=True) flow so the hub
# singleton and per-device port resolution are reused from the test fixtures.
